{"instances": [{"prompt": "Cartoon style image, dynamic action shot, view from slightly elevated behind home plate.\n\nSetting: A major league baseball field, brightly lit with a slight afternoon shadow towards first base. Scoreboard visible in the background, displaying \"Home - 2, Away - 4\", \"8th Inning\", \"1 Out\".\n\nPlayers:\n* **Batter:** Right-handed batter in mid-swing, bat connecting with the ball, sending a ground ball towards the second base hole.  Bat should be slightly blurred to indicate motion.\n* **Runner (1st Base):**  Mid-stride between first and second base, body leaning towards second, in a full sprint.  A cloud of dust puffs up behind his cleats.  He should appear to have started running *before* the bat connected with the ball to illustrate the \"hit and run\" strategy.\n* **Pitcher:**  Left-handed pitcher in his follow-through motion, eyes focused on the batted ball.\n* **Catcher:** Crouched behind home plate, watching the ball as it is hit.  His mitt should be slightly open, indicating the pitch has just been released.\n* **First Baseman:**  Moving towards the first base line, anticipating a throw from the second baseman if the ball gets through.\n* **Second Baseman:**  Running towards the right-field side of second base, attempting to field the ground ball hit into the gap.  His glove should be outstretched towards the ball.\n* **Shortstop:** Covering second base, anticipating a throw from the second baseman.\n* **Third Baseman:**  Positioned slightly to his left, watching the play develop.\n* **Outfielders:**  Positioned in standard outfield positions, observing the play.\n\nOther details: The infield dirt should be clearly defined.  The baseline between first and second should have a clearly visible chalk line. Add some exaggerated motion lines around the batted ball and the runner to emphasize the speed and action.  Maintain a cartoonish aesthetic throughout, with slightly exaggerated player proportions and expressions of focus and determination.\n"}], "parameters": {"sampleCount": 1, "aspectRatio": "16:9"}}
